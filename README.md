Weekly medication management app

The user have the option to add a new medicine.
Each medicine has a name, day of taking the medicine, time of taking, amount and a picture that the user chooses from his gallery.

Any medicine added will appear to the user on the days he chose.
On the weekly screen, he will be able to choose the day he wants and see the medications to be taken that day - divided by hours.
When he clicks on the medicine - a screen will open that will show him the full details about the medicine.

The user will be able at any time to choose another character from the application's database and change the system color - by clicking on the image of the character on the weekly screen.
There, he will also be able to log out.

If the user is new, immediately upon his first login, he will have the option to choose the character and the system color.

It is important to note that the pictures of the drugs in the videos do not correspond to the real drugs, but were taken as an example.
